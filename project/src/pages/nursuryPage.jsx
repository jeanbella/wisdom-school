          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mb-6">
            At Wisdom School, our Nursery Section marks the beginning of an exciting educational journey 
            a place where every child’s curiosity is nurtured, creativity is celebrated, and confidence is built. 
            We believe that early childhood is the foundation for lifelong learning, and our program is carefully designed 
            to inspire young learners to explore, discover, and grow in a warm and stimulating environment.
          </p>

          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mb-6">
            We follow the rich National Curriculum of Rwanda, guided by the National Examination and School Inspection Authority (NESA). 
            This ensures that our pupils acquire essential knowledge, skills, and values in line with the Early Childhood Development (ECD) framework, 
            helping them build a solid foundation for primary education and beyond.

          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Beyond the national curriculum, Wisdom School integrates modern global teaching practices to enrich learning. 
            Inspired by Montessori and Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) approaches, our teachers use creative, child-centered methods 
            that encourage independence, exploration, and critical thinking.
          </p>

          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Classrooms are vibrant spaces of discovery where children learn by doing — engaging in projects, experiments, and play-based lessons 
            that make learning enjoyable and meaningful. Teachers act as facilitators, guiding learners to think independently and express their ideas confidently.
          </p>

          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mb-6">
            At Wisdom School, we prepare our learners to meet the demands of a changing world. Our curriculum embraces cross-cutting issues emphasized 
            in Rwanda’s Competence-Based Curriculum, including environmental protection, gender equality, peace education, digital literacy, and cultural diversity.
          </p>

          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Through these themes, our pupils develop awareness of global challenges, empathy toward others, and the courage to become responsible young citizens.
          </p>

          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mb-6">
            At Wisdom School Nursery, we don’t just teach — we nurture hearts and minds. Our mission is to raise engaged, confident, and well-rounded pupils 
            ready to meet the world with curiosity, creativity, and character.
