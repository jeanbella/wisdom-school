          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mb-6">
            At Wisdom School, our Primary Section is where learning takes shape and purpose is born. 
            It is a vibrant community of young learners guided by wisdom, faith, and excellence — a place where curiosity grows into understanding, 
            and understanding blossoms into confidence.

            in life and contribute meaningfully to society.
          </p>

          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mb-6">
            We proudly uphold our slogan — <strong>“Our Children, Our Future,”</strong> and our motto — <strong>“Fearing God is Knowledge.”</strong> 
            These define who we are: a school that believes true education combines academic excellence, moral integrity, and faith in God.
