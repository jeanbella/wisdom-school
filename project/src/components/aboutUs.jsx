          Who We Are
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Wisdom Schools Rwanda is a family-centered education community dedicated to nurturing learners who grow in knowledge, character, and faith. We believe education is a shared journey between the school, parents, and community, united in shaping responsible and compassionate citizens prepared for the challenges of the modern world.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Founded in 2008 with just five students, Wisdom Schools Rwanda began as a humble seed of faith and vision to transform lives through Kingdom of God–centered education. Through God’s blessings and the continued trust of our community, that small beginning has grown into a chain of thriving schools across the nation, each committed to excellence in academics, character formation, and innovation. Today, as of 2025, Wisdom Schools stands as a testimony of God’s grace and dedication to quality education—a network producing top achievers and responsible citizens.

          A Legacy of Excellence
        </h3>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Since our humble beginnings, Wisdom Schools Rwanda has consistently produced the best of the best—students who excel academically and embody strong moral and spiritual values. Over the years, our learners have achieved outstanding results at both national and regional levels, positioning Wisdom Schools among Rwanda’s top-performing institutions.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        In 2019, our student HUMURA ELVIN made us proud by becoming the first in the country, a milestone that inspired our continued pursuit of excellence. Once again, in 2024–2025, we celebrate ARAKAZA LEO VICTOR from Wisdom School Musanze, who became the first in Rwanda with an impressive average score of 99.4% in the Primary Leaving Examination (PLE). These achievements are not just academic triumphs  they are a testimony to our school’s commitment to quality education, disciplined learning, and God-centered success.
