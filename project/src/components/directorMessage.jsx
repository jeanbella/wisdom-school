            Dear Parents, Students, Staff, and Friends of Wisdom Schools Rwanda,
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed mb-4">
            It gives me great joy to welcome you to the official website of Wisdom Schools Rwanda — a family-centered education community dedicated to nurturing learners who grow in knowledge, character, and faith.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Since our humble beginning in 2008 with only five students, God’s grace and the trust of our community have enabled us to grow into a nationwide network of thriving schools. Each of our campuses stands as a beacon of excellence — committed to transforming lives through personal discovery and self-awareness strategies that help our students and pupils understand their potential and purpose in life.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed mb-4">
            At Wisdom Schools, our vision is not only to educate but to build strong children for a strong Rwanda. We believe that true education shapes both the mind and the heart, producing individuals who are academically competent, morally upright, and spiritually grounded.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Our achievements — from consistent top national results to inspiring stories of transformation — are a reflection of teamwork among teachers, parents, and students who share one purpose: to serve God and build a better future for our nation.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed mb-4">
            As we continue to grow and innovate, our commitment remains unwavering — to provide holistic, value-based education that inspires young minds to think critically, act responsibly, and lead courageously.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Welcome to Wisdom Schools Rwanda — where faith meets excellence and learning transforms lives.
          </p>
